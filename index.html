                Goshen Springs is an institution created by Moses Buli, with help from donors, to help a total of 108 pupils from the local community get proper basic education. We believe that education is key to the success of our pupils. We believe that education
                plays an important role in empowering our kids to think critically, make discrete decisions and become the leaders of tomorrow.

                    Due to a financial hurdle, the Headmaster of Joy Geomar Primary school, the only primary school at Impiron, decided to discontinue the school (2019). The closure of Joy Geomar led to the displacement of 150 pupils who could no longer attend school. Moses
                    Buli, the sole proprietor of Kilimanjaro Resort, decided to start Goshen Springs, a new primary school created to accommodate the displaced students. Goshen Springs is currently under development and we are currently seeking all the
                    help that we could possibly find in order to fully develop the school.
